<h2>29/05/2022 - Antinatalism is the only way</h2>

<p>Antinatalism is the only Philosophy that proposes a <strong>robust</strong> solution to the amount of suffering experienced by consciousness(es) of the universe. 
The main argument proposed by many thinkers over the years (Schopenhauer, Benatar, de Giraud, Al-Ma&#39;arri etc...) consists of the following :
Non-existence is <strong>Always</strong> preferable to existence. The basis of this statement can be represented in this simple table :</p>

<pre style="text-align: justify; color: white; margin-left: 28%;">   
          existence | non-existence 
     ---------------|---------------
   Presence of Pain |  Absence of Pain
      (Bad)         |         (Good)
     ---------------|---------------
Presence of Pleasure|   Absence of Pleasure
        (Good)      |          (Bad)
</pre>

<p>The strength of the argument conveyed by this table can be improved given how Pleasure is a bottomless bucket. We humans are very much damned to a fate similar to the one of the Danaïdes.
The human mind is constantly craving more and more pleasure, it doesn&#39;t have any limit. On the other hand, our biology imposes a upper limit to the amount of pleasure that can be experienced.
Your brain can only produce so much pleasure hormones, and eventually the &quot;pleasure receptors&quot; in your brain <strong>will numb</strong>. 
Even billions of dollars, unlimited orgies, limitless access to the finest pleasures of this world, nothing will <strong>EVER</strong> suffice. The human wants more, always and forever more. We can deduce that no matter what, the human mind will experience desires and cravings that will not be fullfilled.
This in turn will create suffering. Conclusion, with existence even the presence of Pleasure is bad.</p>

<p>Even though Antinatalism is the obvious solution, there is a reason why it is not well known and fiercely rejected by the large majority of <del>breeder</del> people. 
My best guess is that Antinatalism threatens carnal pleasures such as unprotected sex. Seeing how Veganism is fiercely fought by basically every non-vegan for the same reason (the threatened carnal pleasure being tasty meat), it is very likely that i correctly identified the phenomenon at play.</p>

<p>Be kind to your future children, don&#39;t concieve them.</p>
