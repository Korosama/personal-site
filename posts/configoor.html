<p>It&#39;s quite difficult to put into words how I&#39;m feeling these days.
I&#39;ve fallen for <strong>every single</strong> tech/linux meme that i&#39;ve came across :</p>
<ul>
<li>Switching to parabola because of muh kernel blobs.</li>
<li>Ditching systemd.</li>
<li>Daily driving a Librebooted Thinkpad.</li>
<li>Using as much Suckless software as possible.</li>
<li>Using only cli/ncurses apps. </li>
</ul>
<p>I feel like I&#39;ve reached peak computing, everything I&#39;d ever want to do is a keybind away.
All I do is watching bash scripts running at the push of a button and do all my work while I listen to music.</p>
<p>This situation led me to develop a configooring addiction. My weekends are spent endlessly 
recompiling my software in order to make the font size of dwm a pixel smaller, some color a touch darker or 
a keybind a little closer to my fingers. Alas ! This endless, meaningless cycle&#39;s purpose was only to distract me from 
the inevitable realization that it was all about the journey and not the destination.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal">Pywal</a> greatly helped to mitigate this behavior that I think a lot of people can relate to.
  This revolutionary tool takes an image as input and automatically generates a colorscheme. Simply type :</p>
  <pre> wal -i YOUR_IMAGE </pre>
  <p>and let the script do the job. Even better than that, it generates files that perfectly fit in the configuration of a variety of software.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve particularly took interest in these files : <strong>colors-wal-dwm.h</strong> and 
<strong>colors.Xresources</strong>.</p>
<p>Turns out that you can automatically input the colorscheme generated by pywal into your dwm config aswell as loading the .Xresources.</p>

<h3>I - dwm</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Delete these lines in your config.def.h :</p></li>

<pre>static const char col_gray1[]  = &quot;#222222&quot;;
static const char col_gray2[]       = &quot;#444444&quot;;
static const char col_gray3[]       = &quot;#bbbbbb&quot;;
static const char col_gray4[]       = &quot;#eeeeee&quot;;
static const char col_cyan[]        = &quot;#005577&quot;;
static const char colors[][3]      = {
    /                   fg         bg         border   */
    [SchemeNorm] = { col_gray3, col_gray1, col_gray2 },
    [SchemeSel]  = { col_gray4, col_cyan,  col_cyan  },
};</pre>
<li><p>replace them by : </p></li>
<pre>#include "/home/YOUR_USER_NAME/.cache/wal/colors-wal-dwm.h"</pre>
</ul>
<p>Voila, when you generate a colorscheme and recompile dwm the colorscheme will automatically be used.</p>

<h3>II - .Xresources</h3>

<ul>
<p>This is pretty straightforward, just move the file wherever you want and xrdb it :</p>

<pre>cp $HOME/.cache/wal/colors.Xresources $HOME/.Xresources</pre>
<pre>xrdb $HOME/.Xresources</pre>
</ul>
<p>Tip : If you use the suckless terminal, consider applying the <a href="https://st.suckless.org/patches/xresources/">Xresources patch</a>
in order to have your terminal colors automatically synced too.</p>
<p>Being aware of this, I did the natural thing and wrote a script to automate all of that : </p>

<pre>#!/bin/sh
[ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] &amp;&amp; echo &quot;Please provide an image as argument.&quot; &amp;&amp; exit;
echo -e -e &quot;Setting wallpaper ... \n&quot;
xwallpaper --zoom $1 &amp;&amp; cp /home/YOUR_USER_NAME/.cache/wal/colors.Xresources /home/YOUR_USER_NAME/.xresources &amp;&amp; xrdb .xresources &amp;&amp; echo -e &quot;done. \n&quot;
echo -e &quot;Generating colorscheme ... \n&quot;
wal -s -i $1 &gt; /dev/null &amp;&amp; sed -i &#39;17d&#39; /home/YOUR_USER_NAME/.cache/wal/colors-wal-dwm.h &amp;&amp; echo -e &quot;done. \n&quot;
echo -e &quot;Recompiling dwm ... \n&quot;
cd /home/YOUR_USER_NAME/Repos/dwm/ &amp;&amp; rm config.h &amp;&amp; sudo make clean install &gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; echo -e &quot;done. \n&quot;
echo -e &quot;All done, please restart dwm.&quot;
</pre>

<p style="color: red;"><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE : If for some reason you configured your dwm in config.h and not config.def.h, this script will DELETE your config !!!</strong></p>

<p>I think that it wouldn't be an overstatement to say that python-pywal saved me from the soy configoorer ideology.
It taught me to stop chasing the omega perfect setup that would finally scratch that itch; simply because that dream setup does not exist.
It is a fabrication of the mind.
Just settle for something good & modular, get on with your life and projects and start to get some work done.</p>
<p>Speaking of projects, I would greatly take projects ideas that are not a multimedia home server and do not cost 1k€.
I know my way around bash scripting, basic server setups, Arduino, Soldering. Figured it would be a cool way to
make use of those skills and devellop them. However, hours of browsing Lainchan did not help me finding something useful to do.
So whoever is reading this (as if anybody will ever be reading this lol) shoot me any cool project ideas !
