<h2 id="14-05-2022-BMS-Improvement">14/05/2022 - BMS Improvement</h2>
<p>After almost 2 1/2 months of playing BMS with a controller, i can finally start to catch up to my keyboard level. Managed to dig into the satellite table and a few of the easier ★1's, kinda nice to have a larger selection of songs to play and not being forced to play the same 10 charts back to back. I think that scores are not worth sharing yet (being only low accuracy low sl0 clear (yes i play for lamps)) but still quite happy of the improvement. </p>
<p>The main thing that allowed me to ascend from strugling w/ easy ☆9 to obtaining decent scores on ☆11-11+ is radically changing my playstyle. </p>
<p>While getting into the IIDX/BMS rabbit hole, i've always been amazed by top rankers's playstyle being so smooth and snappy; but most importantly their ability to freestyle between multiple techniques involing a lot of cool hand movements flowing perfectly with the gracious notes of the music. The second that i got my BM between my hands, i swore an oath to never use boring static wrist scratch technique and to walk in the path of the cool freestyle DOLCE-like player. Huge Mistake. I spent countless hours trying to play the most basic stuff while continually transitioning between 3/5 thumb slide, 2/5 split, 北斗 and freeform. litterally zero improvement for weeks and even made me quit the game for a few days.</p>

<strong><h5><u>3/5 Thumb slide was my main technique</u></h5></strong>
<p>I am now free of the oath that i took and began adopting the 1048 technique as my main one and it does <strong>WONDERS</strong>. i am still thankfull that i practiced all of these other techniques that allow me to breeze through technical scratch sections.</p>
